# snake
Simple Snake clone in Haskell.

## Quick disclaimer
This project is not currently being maintained.  
The version with graphics (`game.hs`) still needs some work and, mainly, debugging. The text-based one (`textGame.hs`) seems to be working properly, although it's more of a "game session simulator" than an actual game.
